File Inclusion/ Traversal Vulnerabilities:
===========================================

Path traversal or directory traversal is a vulnerability which allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server which they should not have access

However an attacker does not know the name or contents of files present in the server, so an attacker can look for default files present in server , like passwd file present inside etc directory in linux os. and boot.ini file present in windows os.

The checklist for this attack is:

1. Check directly for the /etc/passwd if in a linux system.
-------------------------------------------------------------
You can try adding as many "../../../../../' as possible and see whether you will retrieve it.
You can try looking for the boot.ini file in the windows OS. 

2. You can also check without the "../../../" since server may be configured to block the traversal sequences. So instead of using the "../../../" no matter where you are if you just type the "/etc/passwd/" You will still get the output.
So this just checks the "../../../../../" traversal sequences.

3. You can also check the traversal sequences stripped non-recursively
